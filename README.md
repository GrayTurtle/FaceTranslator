# Face2Book

## Technologies Used

## How to Run

## Inspiration
Adding people on Facebook can be so cumbersome because you have to ask for their username or look them up. We wanted to invent a new way to add people on Facebook that is efficient and fun. So we came up with Face2Book!

## What it does
With the Face2Book app, one can use it to snap a selfie of their new friend, and it will automatically pull up their Facebook profile!

## How we built it
In the back-end, we used Python to scrape information on users on Facebook (their name and profile picture using their user id) to obtain data. We then send that data to a Microsoft Azure server that has a Face API for it to train. Then it decides if the picture matches up with your friend, and if it does, it pulls up their Facebook profile!

## Challenges we ran into
Getting the data set from Facebook
Graph API only gets friends who use the Graph API

## What we learned

Facebook Graph API
Microsoft Azure

## What's next for FaceTranslator
